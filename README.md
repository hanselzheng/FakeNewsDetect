# FakeNewsDetect
This is a program that uses machine learning to detect fake news articles. The machine uses supervised learning and binary classification to detect fake (1) and real (0) news.
This program also allows users to log in through their Google accounts.

However, the machine is not fully integrated into the website. Therefore, to access the machine, un-comment the code at the end of machine.py to test the machine.
